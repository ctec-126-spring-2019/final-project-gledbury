I changed my project...hopefully this is acceptable.

After I started working on the cards project a different idea came to me that I wanted to do.

It is a game....There are 3 Bruces at the top of the screen and 1 George at the bottom..George apparentley got an answer wrong and the Bruces keep throwing cows at him.(if you dont want me to use a pic of you just let me know)

George will be moved with the mouse and he will try to catch the cows before they hit the ground.
There is a score at the top and George will lose a life each time he misses a cow.
The cows will be thrown faster and faster.

So far I have some CSS and most of the HTML done...will need to refine them.

Next I need to work on the functions to get it all to work.
