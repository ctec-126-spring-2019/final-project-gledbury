For My Final Project I would like to do the following:

I will take the Card Deck application and expand it to a matching game.

# Page 1---This page will consist of a form, with validation and error buckets, that the user will input his information....Name, Age,Sex, etc...The submit button will store the data as well as proceed the user to page 2.

# Page 2---This page will consist of the actual game.  It will be a standard 52 card deck dealt face down.  The user will click on a card followed by a second card...if they are of the same value then they will be removed from the table...then it is repeated...the program will keep track of how many "turns" are taken to clear the table...2 clicks = 1 turn.  When all cards are cleared,  the program will load page 3.

# Page 3--- This page will compile the statistics and display the results...depending on the score I will display a ribbon and tell them how great they are at this game.

# I don't have a group to work with.....doing this completely solo...wish me luck!!
